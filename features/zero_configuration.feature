Feature: Zero configuration
  Background:
    Given I run webpack in watch mode
    And the server has started

  Scenario: The entry file is modified
    When the entry file is modified
    Then the output should include "[nodemon] restarting due to changes..."
    And the server should restart

  Scenario: A file not related to the entry file is modified
    When a file unrelated to the entry file is modified
    Then the server shouldn't restart
