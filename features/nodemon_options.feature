Feature: Support nodemon options

  Scenario: nodemon is asked to watch the whole output directory
    Given the following nodemon config:
      """
      {
          watch: outputDir,
      }
      """
    And I run webpack in watch mode
    And the server has started
    When a file unrelated to the entry file is modified
    Then the output should include "[nodemon] restarting due to changes..."
    And the server should restart

  Scenario: pass arguments to the output script
    Given the following nodemon config:
      """
      {
          args: [ '--port', '4096' ],
      }
      """
    And I run webpack in watch mode
    Then the server should start with the arguments "[ '--port', '4096' ]"
